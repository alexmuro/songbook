  The first handful of listens leave me with the impression that this album is not bad. There are no songs though that jump out and grab you, and while this is certainly a continuation of what Woods have been doing for years its probably an album I'll forget. Sun City and the Eater of Light or whatever the name of that record was  some songs that really reached out and gripped me, but Love is Love just felt like the same song over and over again, and this album seems like that.

  I do love the Woods bass tone, and snare sound but otherwise the production here is so safe as to be boring. The keyboard / flute sounds used in instrumentals are pretty but unimaginative and too clean. 

  The first songs Next to You and the Sea blends in almost without changing to the second song Where Do You Go When You Dream, who's chorus is the first interesting thing on the album. 

  Before they pass by is boring.

  Can't get out is also boring.

  This album makes me wonder about how lyrics work in music in that, the lyrics seems to purposefully never pull me towards them. I listen to this whole album and there isn't a single line that makes me pay attention to what is being said. People often talk about how they don't really listen to music for the lyrics and they don't ever remember lyrics but some albums just leave me with a sense the songs are about something and a lot of songs just aren't. This doesn't even have to be a profound something or a beautiful something, but I think on some level there are songs that are just using words as filler.

  Strange to explain is boring.

  The Void opens with a pretty dope riff and goes nowhere
