The plains roll forever
          D                a   e        
and we're too few to count the days
      D              A  E
in my dreams I can remember
  D                    A E
a time when we weren't afriad

G                    A
its hard to say what happened
    C#m              E
its hard to know for sure 
                        E7
but the letters that you opened 
      C#m            G#
with intentions to restore
				A
can only cause confusion
     E                 C#m
with their memories so pure

The highway lights the question
asked a thousand times since youth
and a thousand answers in contention
fight like children to be called the truth

I like to think I've given
more than I took away
with the distance I have driven
for some reason we can't quite say
I could only call confusion
in the this addleworn age
