D       G/b        D       G/b   
I can't claim that I never made mistakes
D              G/b                 D       G/b   
if you saw me travelling would you turn the other way
A* 
its hard to learn the difference 
G
between forgiveness and grace
A* 
sometimes I can't help think about
G
the look upon his face

its easeir to say you think things are unfair
theres nothing wrong with kissing but a promise is a swear
sometimes the path we travel is
distantly unclear
and its hard to remember exaclty why
we ended it up hear


Chorus
and when I saw
G               A7        G/b
a man who knew all of the words
             A7
loooked with love upon
    G/b            A7
the plants and the birds
     G
this path that was once
A7       G/b
again it returns
            A7
all that we lost
   G       A*
is gone in turns


I wish I knew what you wanted to be
it was easier to think about ways to be free
If I cannot convince you 
that what you did was wrong
I guess I'd rather pretend
that I never read along

left to decide what path to undertake
freedom is a blessing, a choice is a mistake
boredome always calls you
to leave it all alone
how many times can you try
before you claim to have known


chorus
