C   Em   G   Am   F   G   C //  Em  F   G   C 


C    Em    G   Am7
Take every answer 
	 F       G       C
look back at what it means
C    Em    G   Am7
beware the chancer
F       Em   F    G       C
staring back only at your greed


F        Em       G   Am
When you know you are alone
F        G       C
then you finally see


C    Em    G   Am7
Find another dancer 
	 F       G       C
to put on the stage with me
C    Em    G   Am7
beware the chancer
F       Em   F    G       C
staring back only at your greed



F        Em       G   Am
take the hour you have sewn 
F         G      F        G        C 
with open hand   all  you planned will be
