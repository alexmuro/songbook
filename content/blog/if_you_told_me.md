C7   C6  C4  Bb              Am
When I  was  young I used to go
         Gm            C
Early to bed I'd never know
C7 C6  C4  Bb         Am
fallen asleep just to awake
           Gm         C 
I'd try to put my book away
            F   
but its was gone
                    C             Bb    F
we were lost and we lost track of hours 
                         C               Bb
I never knew there was a time you can't see
                   F            (C) Bb
if you told me I'd believe you 
                         F  (C) Bb       
but I can't seem to see
                    F  C   Bb
if you told me I'd beleive you 
           F         C C4 C
i'm only remembering
	


and when I saw, the sun of mourning
I I I knew my time was drawing 
to-o a close, with this warning  
I wonder what will soon be before me
is it the light
we were lost and we lost track of hours 
I never knew there was a time you can't see
if you told me I'd believe you 
but I can't seem to see
if you told me I'd beleive you 
i'm only remembering
