D6              Bm7       Asus    Bm7
Dear Charlotte, you don't know I exist
   D6            Bm7          Asus           Bm7
we met once in a basement but haven't talked since
    Gadd9          D6 
but when my memory serves me
     Gadd9          D6
your name conjures for me
  Gadd9  D6    Bm7   D6
a face I won't soon forget 


CHORUS
D6 Bm7 Asus Gadd9
D6         Bm7             Asus Gadd9
You've got eyes I've never seen behind
D6             Bm7        Asus  Gadd9
just a passing glimpse of whats inside


Dear Charlotte, won't you tell me how have you been
does time treat your fairly wherever you may live
have you taken a lover 
and do you love him
I can't help by wondering

CHORUS
You live a life thats parallell to mine
bound to never cross again this side of time

Dear Charlotte, I will meet you by the old Okkerville
but don't you worry because all is well
I just want to tell you
while I'm thinking of you
it makes me happy you exist
