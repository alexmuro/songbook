A           D       A        E
It seems so strange when you remember
F#m       D       A           E  
just how alone we are in this life
   A                  E      A        E 
we search through the places dark and disgusting
F#m           D         E            A
for something lovely to balance the strife

Instrumental Chorus
D F# E
D A  E E

I've been a searcher not easily answered
yet I have seen beauty a handful of times
I've learned not to grasp it and turn it to ashes
to let it pass with playing misery's chimes

Chorus
  D            F#       
Theres nothing I can do
   E                D
to take your dreams away
                 A
theres always a reason
E                                     D 
that makes it worth your time to want stay


In searching for something I desperately wanted (down in the valley)
I gave my self freely and I was afraid
I knew that the right thing to do was nothing
no one can know then things are alright


Instrumental Chorus
D F# E
D A  E E



With six young cowboys all wrapped in white linen
and six pretty maiden's who bared me their souls
I arrived at a moment not noeeding an answer
and I could embrace nothing at all

Chorus
  D            F#       
Theres nothing I can do
   E                D
to take your dreams away
                 A
theres always a reason
E                                     D 
that makes it worth your time to want stay
