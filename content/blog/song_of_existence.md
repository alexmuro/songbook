 G               (C)      G
 There was a bird in the distance
           C          G
 singing a song of existance
        D               C
 with a quality sad and mythic
                          G
 I could not help but sing with it

 Somethings I'll never understand
 in those strange lovely scenes of command
 and the images of hallowed burning night
 and the constant hour of flight

 there is a single simple secret
 I don't know exacly why I can keep it
 in the exhange of time and experience
 you see which sacrifice is serious

 to tame or to be tamed
 its not something to be explained
 I'll always remember that song
 that changed what it means to belong
