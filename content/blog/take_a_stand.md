A                    Bm   
It's easier than you think
D                        A 
to change someone's life forever
F#                               E 
but I'm too chicken shit that it might be revealed
D
that someone actually hates me

Bm C#m A E x2 


I wonder why we are so careful
on a day when I have seen you 
for a couple of years in a meaningful way
Something is always real for us

even though nothing is correctat
the circumstances always suspect
Its hard than you suspect
to really make soneone hate you

to give up on your forever
we are such suckers for redepmtion
the simple facts of some fabric
covering our skin

or the mix of cars passing
on a nearby road
conspired on this particular day
...
