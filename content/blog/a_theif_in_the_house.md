G                       G7
Take a look back at the face you were wearing
       C                         G 
Take a look at the ways you've become
         Em                  Bm       
is there something deep down we are avoiding
 C             D       G
now that we've finally begun

There was a moment I thought was future
what were you doing there in grin
its was just another hopeful daydream
aww its just so hard to  begin

take a look at your reputation
domestic or otherwise in the wind
and you ask me how could this happen?
but I don't know where to begin

Chorus
C                         G
Theres a theif in the house now
    C                G 
searchin through all your clothes
C                  G    
but you can't find nothin missing
C          D                G
ain't that just the way it goes

Take me back to the days when we could
look each other right in the eyes
its not that it got any harder
but theres always that look of suprise

Tomorrows always coming like a strange invasion
are there answers that are right but not true
I'm not sure I like it but I had a great nightmare
I saw you crying but it wasn't you

Chorus

Theres a theif in the house now
he's looking under the floor  
thinking he aleady found you
just to say my darling j'adore

there was a time when I knew what I wanted
it was nice to feel so sure not to quit
but in life there are only two curses
to not get what you want or to get it

can you head the cautious narration
oh its so hard to explain
but when it stops you'll know you always heard it
and your life will seem so plain seems so plain

Chorus

Theres a theif in the house now
he's playing with all your toys
he's got a face full of wonder
he;s wondering why your so annoyed

theres nothing that I can tell you
that you don't already know
you wonder why I am talking
it just helps pass the time that's all
