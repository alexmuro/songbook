F              C/G
Flowers in the city
F                         C/G
they bloom and then their gone
F 				C/G
but if you can tell me 
Am                  Em
by who's hand their drawn
Am               Em 
nothing needs explaining 
F                    C/g 
but someone says your wrong
F                    C/g 
the Daucus grew  from cells that knew
Am                  Em 
the angles of their call

CHORUS
Am                Em 
before the golden dawn
Am                Em 
before the golden dawn
Am          Em 
there is no name 
F                C/G
That we can call upon


Take me back to your place
when you lived out on the lawn
playing games and talking
of impossible moments won
I wonder what we've become
living like bears and fawns
how can we understand
all the friends we lost

CHORUS
before the golden dawn
before the golden dawn
there is no name 
That we can call upon
