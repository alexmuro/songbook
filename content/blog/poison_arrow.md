G                C
looking down the road
G            C   
for what was told
G             Em
there must be something
Bm                  C
that will break the hold
Am      Em   Bm        C 
I'll be gone once I've sold
G           C          Em  D C G 
the measure all that I owed

at the breaking of the day
I asked if you would stay
tomorrow will come 
but I'll be far away
sing a song for the highway
we never talked much anyway

Instrumental
Bm   Em  G6sus2 G6 G6sus2 G6
Bm   Em  G6sus2 G6 G6sus2 G6
C Bm   Em  G

struck by an arrow
poisoned and narrow
brought to a surgeon
refused blood & marrow
you must find the wrecthed banidellero
i'd rather die than not knows

what was his name
tell me who to blame
where would I go if I can

all that remains
from that awful pain
is a sweet sense that
theres no reason to complain
dead and gone to where no one knows the way
if only now I could explain

Instrumental
---------------

sometimes you wonder
about the great blue yonder
taking a breath
to feel the pull much stronger
are questions its better not to ponder
am I my body or another
