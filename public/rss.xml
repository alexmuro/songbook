Take a look back at the face you were wearing
C                         G
Take a look at the ways you have become
Em                  Bm&lt;br&gt;
is there something deep down we are avoiding
C             D       G
now that we’ve finally begun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a moment I thought was future
what were you doing there in grin
maybe it was just another hopeful daydream
oh its just so hard to  begin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chorus
C                         G
There was only one option under
C                G
the price that you’d survive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C                  G&lt;br&gt;
makes you stop and wander
C          D                G
how in the first place we’d arrive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrows always coming like a strange invasion
are there answers that are right but not true
I’m not sure I like it but I had a great nightmare
I saw you crying but it wasn’t you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can try for hours and make &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[All the Words]]></title><description><![CDATA[D       G/b        D       G/b I can’t claim that I never made mistakes

I can’t claim that I never made mistakes
D              G/b                 D       G/b&lt;br&gt;
if you saw me travelling would you turn the other way
A*
its hard to learn the difference
G
between forgiveness and grace
A*
sometimes I can’t help think about
G
the look upon his face&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;its easeir to say you think things are unfair
theres nothing wrong with kissing but a promise is a swear
sometimes the path we travel is
distantly unclear
and its hard to remember exaclty why
we ended it up hear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chorus
and when I saw
G               A7        G/b
a man who knew all of the words
A7
loooked with love upon
G/b            A7
the plants and the birds
G
this path that was once
A7       G/b
again it returns
A7
all that we lost
G       A*
is gone in turns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I knew what you wanted to be
it was easier to think about ways to be free
If I cannot convince you
that what you did was wrong
I guess I’d rather pretend
that I never read along&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;left to decide what path to undertake
freedom is a blessing, a choice is a mistake
boredome always calls you
to leave it all alone
how many times can you try
before you claim to have known&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Somethings I’ll never understand

I don’t know exacly why I can keep it
in the exhange of time and experience

&lt;p&gt;what was his name
tell me who to blame
where would I go if I can&lt;/p&gt;

theres no reason to complain
dead and gone to where no one knows the way

about the great blue yonder
taking a breath

are questions its better not to ponder
